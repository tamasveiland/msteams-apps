Scenario 2: Creating a survey 

This app supports only multiple-choice questions. The questions and the people to whom the survey should be published are shared with the bot as an Excel file. The sample Excel sheet is attached in the preview section for reference. 

Once you set an admin, when you initiate a conversation with the bot, it gives you options to create a survey, download the results of a survey, or even send a reminder to those who have not filled the survey yet.

Choose “Create Survey” and share the Excel spreadsheet with details of questions, answer options, and members to whom this survey should be pushed out. The survey will be sent as a notification only if the app is pre-installed by the user. 

As soon as the Excel file is received by the bot, it shows format of the questions extracted from the spreadsheet and, upon verification, you can publish the survey.
